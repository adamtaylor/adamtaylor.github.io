title: Mixins, Traits, Roles and Moose
---

The traditional [single] inheritence system, as taught in computer science classes
is generally considered to be over-simplistic for real-wolrd systems. It's not
often that classes fit neatly in a `Mamal > Dog > Poodle` classification. Multiple
inheritence was supposed to fix the limitations of single inheritence but again it
failed to address the underlying assumption that inheritence is a sensible
way to model complex systems.

In addition to multiple inheritence, other systems have been developed to address
the encapsulation and re-use issues not adequately solved by multiple inheritence.
Two systems that have acheived mainstream use are 'mixins' and 'traits', their
strengths and limitions will be discussed further.

> CLOS (Lisp), Smalltalk, Java, BETA, OCaml, Ruby and more, while still keeping
> true to its Perl 5 roots.
